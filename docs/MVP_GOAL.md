# MVP Simple Branch

Goal: build a minimal working Telegram bot.

No event orchestration.
No multi-service architecture.
No advanced AI logic.

Requirements:
- single process bot
- aiogram polling
- /status command
- /task add
- /tasks list
- sqlite or postgres
- reminders

This branch exists to validate product usability before continuing architecture work.
